I am a software engineer at Google working on mobile computational photography with the Android Camera Algorithms team!

Previously, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/). As a member of the [CMU Graphics Lab](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu) and the [CMU Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu), I researched interesting problems in computer graphics and geometry processing. This culminated in my [Master's Thesis](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/calendar/fri-2019-07-19-1500/computer-science-5th-year-masters-thesis-presentation) on remeshing geometric surfaces.

I also completed my undergraduate studies at Carnegie Mellon, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Robotics. Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, playing video/boardgames with friends, and listening to [music](https://www.last.fm/user/connorzl) (long-time swiftie). Also a fan of traveling, sports, and good food :)
